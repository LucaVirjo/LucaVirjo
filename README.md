# THE LOTTO APP

This app was created as a school project to demonstrate how unlikely it is to win the lottery. Firstly the app asks the user to input the numbers they want on their lotto ticket, one by one. Then the app calculates the lottery each week, notifying the user each time there's a bigger win than before. When the user has gotten all 7 numbers right, the app checks if the win was aquired in less than a human lifetime (120 years in the app). If it was the app stops running, if not it tries again.

When creating this app, I was focusing on making it easy to modify to work with different lottery games or even a different language. I also made all af the util classes so that they are language neutral, and the text outputted by them is given in the parameters of the method.
